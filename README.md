# BigIdeasMath-Unlimited-Checks-MRL-URL
Want unlimited checks on your BigIdeasMath homework? Paste this javascript in the console, and get unlimited (well 10000) checks on every problem (this only works if your URL starts with www.bigideasmath.com/MRL)
It should be pasted in the console of the assignment, the URL will look something like https://www.bigideasmath.com/MRL/public/app/#/student/assessment;isPlayerWindow=true;assignmentId=abcdef-1234-5678-9012-abcdefg. Obviously the assignment ID will be different.
